## Mike Edits
Added two 'for' loops that replace a lot of the existing code. 
I left the original commented out so you can check functionality. **ctr+f 'Mike'**
You can use the layout groups like arrays to hold buttons, then use:
```
for b in layoutGroupName.children[:]:
	b.doWhateverYouWant
```
Remember to 'git pull' before you start working on the code, or you will have merge conficts that you will have to fix before you do another 'push'

Best, mike
